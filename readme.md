4 corners test


## AUtomation for Making 4 Corners Disk Testing more successful. ##





What this script does: 


Below are steps and screenshots with information on setting up the disk tests. 


⦁	Unzip 4Corner_Test.7z to “C:\Temp”.  Rename diskspd.__e to diskspd.exe
⦁	Remove the “renameme” extension name. 

 
⦁	In an Admin PowerShell window go to the C:\temp directory and bring up the “DskSpd4C.ps1” file. 

 

⦁	Type in the Drive Letter we’re testing, the example below is using “E”. 

 

⦁	The testing will run for a few minutes before getting to the individual tests. 

 

⦁	The tests will take some time to run.  The results are in the “TestDiskSpd” folder within the “testfile.dat” file. 

 


⦁	Please run the test on each storage unit.  Also label them so we know which file comes from the Compellent and PowerStore units. 
⦁	Next zip files and send in for review. 


If there are questions please let me know.
